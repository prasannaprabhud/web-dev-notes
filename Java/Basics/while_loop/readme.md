Got it 👍 You want **practice questions using `while` loop**.
I’ll give you a mix of **basic, intermediate, and tricky** ones.

### 🔹 Basic `while` loop questions

1. Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
2. Print even numbers from 2 to 20.
3. Print the multiplication table of a given number (e.g., 5).
4. Find the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` (where `n` is given by the user).
5. Reverse the digits of a given number.

### 🔹 Intermediate `while` loop questions

6. Count the number of digits in a given number.
7. Check whether a given number is a palindrome (e.g., 121 → palindrome).
8. Print the Fibonacci series up to `n` terms.
9. Find the factorial of a number.
10. Print all prime numbers between 1 and 100.

### 🔹 Tricky `while` loop questions

11. Keep asking the user for input until they enter `"exit"`.
12. Print the sum of digits of a number until it becomes a single digit (digital root).
13. Generate a pattern like:

```
*
**
***
****
```

using only a while loop.
14\. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using repeated subtraction.
15\. Simulate a simple ATM:

* User has balance = 1000.
* Ask whether they want to withdraw/deposit/exit.
* Update balance accordingly.
