Let’s start with the first common question:

💬 “Tell me about yourself.”

👉 Example Answer (simple English):

My name is [Your Name]. I have completed my bachelor’s degree in Computer Applications.
I have good knowledge of SQL and basic PL/SQL.
I can write queries, create tables, and work with joins and subqueries.
I am interested in database development and always try to improve my technical skills.

Now, let’s say it slowly together:
🗣 “My name is [Your Name]. I have completed my bachelor’s degree in Computer Applications.”
🗣 “I have good knowledge of SQL and basic PL/SQL.”
🗣 “I can write queries, create tables, and work with joins and subqueries.”
🗣 “I am interested in database development and always try to improve my technical skills.”

💬 Question 2:

What is SQL?

👉 Simple English Answer:

SQL means Structured Query Language.
It is used to store, manage, and retrieve data from a database.
With SQL, we can create tables, insert data, update records, and run queries to get information.

🗣 Practice speaking slowly:
“SQL means Structured Query Language.”
“It is used to store, manage, and retrieve data from a database.”
“With SQL, we can create tables, insert data, update records, and run queries to get information.”


💬 Question 3:
What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?
DELETE removes specific rows from a table using a condition.
TRUNCATE removes all the rows from a table at once.
DELETE can be rolled back, but TRUNCATE cannot be rolled back.


💬 Question 4:
What are joins in SQL?
Joins are used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column.
There are different types of joins — INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.


💬 Question 5:
What is a Primary Key?
A Primary Key is a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
It does not allow duplicate or null values.


💬 Question 6:
What is a Subquery?
A subquery is a query inside another query.
It is used to get data that will be used by the main query.
Subqueries can be written in SELECT, WHERE, or FROM clauses.


💬 Question 7:
What is a View in SQL?
A view is a virtual table that shows data from one or more tables.
It stores only the SQL query, not the data itself.
It helps to simplify complex queries and increase security.


💬 Question 8:
What is Normalization?
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
There are several normal forms like 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF.


💬 Question 9:
What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?
INNER JOIN returns only matching rows from both tables.
LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.


💬 Question 10:
How do you improve the performance of an SQL query?
We can improve performance by using indexes, avoiding unnecessary subqueries, using proper joins, and analyzing execution plans.
Also, retrieving only required columns helps increase speed.
