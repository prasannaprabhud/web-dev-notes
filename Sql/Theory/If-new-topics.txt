That’s a good question 👍.
When you want to **learn new SQL concepts (or any technical concept)**, here’s a structured approach you can follow so you don’t feel lost:

---

### 🔹 1. **Start Small with Theory**

* Pick **one concept at a time** (example: Joins, Subqueries, Indexes).
* Read the definition, purpose, and real-life use cases.
* Keep notes in your own words — short and simple.

---

### 🔹 2. **See an Example**

* Look at a sample query that uses the concept.
  Example:

  ```sql
  SELECT E.EMP_NAME, D.DEPT_NAME
  FROM EMPLOYEE E
  INNER JOIN DEPARTMENT D
  ON E.DEPT_ID = D.DEPT_ID;
  ```
* Don’t just read — **understand what each line is doing**.

---

### 🔹 3. **Practice on Your Own**

* Create a **small table** with sample data (5–10 rows).
* Try the concept in different ways:

  * Change conditions.
  * Add variations (INNER JOIN → LEFT JOIN).
  * Test edge cases (NULL values, no matching rows).

---

### 🔹 4. **Ask “Why”**

* Why do we use this concept instead of another?
* What are the pros & cons?
* Example: Why use a `JOIN` instead of a `SUBQUERY`?

---

### 🔹 5. **Summarize & Revise**

* Write 2–3 lines about the concept in your notes.
* Save 1–2 practice queries as examples.
* Revisit after 2 days → helps memory stick.

---

### 🔹 6. **Connect to Real Interview Questions**

* Once you’re comfortable, solve **interview-style problems** with that concept.
  Example: “Find the 2nd highest salary using subquery vs using ranking functions.”

---

👉 Formula to follow every time:
**Theory → Example → Practice → Why → Summarize → Apply in Q&A**

---

Do you want me to design a **learning flow of SQL concepts in order** (so you’ll know what to learn first, second, third… until advanced)?
