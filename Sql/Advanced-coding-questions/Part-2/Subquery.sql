Got it âœ… Hereâ€™s a **set of advanced subquery coding questions** (without answers first, so you can practice). These cover **correlated subqueries, nested subqueries, EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, ANY/ALL**.

## ðŸ”¹ Advanced Subquery Questions

1. Find the employees who earn the **maximum salary in their department** (use a correlated subquery).

2. List the departments where **at least one employee earns more than 80,000** (use `EXISTS`).

3. Find the employees who **do not manage anyone** (use `NOT EXISTS`).

4. Display the employees whose salary is **above the average salary of their department**.

5. Retrieve the employee(s) with the **3rd highest salary** using nested subqueries.

6. List the employees whose department is **not located in Chennai** (use a subquery with `NOT IN`).

7. Find the employees who earn more than **at least one employee in the HR department** (use `ANY`).

8. Find the employees who earn more than **all employees in the HR department** (use `ALL`).

9. Find the employees who have the **same salary as someone in another department** (self-subquery).

10. List departments that have **no employees** (use `NOT EXISTS`).

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to **give answers one by one with explanation** (like before), or first let you **try solving** and then Iâ€™ll show the solutions?
